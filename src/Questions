1. should we initialize class variables with default values?
    i.e: private int capacity; VS private int capacity = 0;

2. comments. on which fields/methods is it good to use comments?

3. how should we implement ToString method? is it ok to concatenate strings/variables with + sign?
    or should we use stringbuilder?
